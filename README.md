# Flower-Classification-Using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
<p>The provided program implements a CNN-based and transfer learning-based model for classifying flower images into five categories. The program utilizes TensorFlow and Keras, showcasing the process of data augmentation, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization of intermediate representations. Additionally, it demonstrates the power of transfer learning using the VGG16 model to improve classification accuracy.</p>
Here's a brief breakdown of the program:

## CNN Model
Data Handling: The dataset is extracted from a zip file and structured into training and validation directories.
Data Augmentation: The program applies various transformations such as rotation, zoom, and flipping to enhance the diversity of training data.
Image Normalization: Pixel values are rescaled to the range [0, 1] to ensure consistent input to the model.

### CNN Architecture:
Convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract spatial features.
Flattening and fully connected layers for classification.
Training Process: The CNN model is trained for 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Model Evaluation: Tracks accuracy and loss on both training and validation datasets during training.
Visualizing Predictions: Displays predictions and actual classes for a batch of test images.
Intermediate Representations: Visualizes feature maps generated by convolutional layers.

### Transfer Learning
Pretrained Model: Uses VGG16 as the base model with frozen layers to leverage pre-trained weights.
Custom Layers: Adds a global average pooling layer, dense layers, and dropout for fine-tuning.
Training Process: Trains the transfer learning model for 10 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001.
Model Evaluation: Tracks accuracy and loss on both training and validation datasets during training.
Performance Visualization: Plots training and validation accuracy and loss.
